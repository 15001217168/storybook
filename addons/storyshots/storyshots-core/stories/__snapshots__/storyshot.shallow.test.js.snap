    Welcome to storybook

  <p>
    This is a UI component dev environment for your app.
  </p>
  <p>
    We've added some basic stories inside the 
    <Styled(code)>
      src/stories
    </Styled(code)>
     directory.
    <br />
    A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as many stories as you want.
    <br />
    (Basically a story is like a visual test case.)
  </p>
  <p>
    See these sample 
    <Styled(button)
      onClick={[Function]}
    >
      stories
    </Styled(button)>
     for a component called
     
    <Styled(code)>
      Button
    </Styled(code)>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like that, you can add your own components as stories.
    <br />
    You can also edit those components and see changes right away.
    <br />
    (Try editing the 
    <Styled(code)>
      Button
    </Styled(code)>
     stories located at
     
    <Styled(code)>
      src/stories/index.js
    </Styled(code)>
    .)
  </p>
  <p>
    Usually we create stories with smaller UI components in the app.
    <br />
    Have a look at the
     
    <Styled(a)

      rel="noopener noreferrer"

      NOTE:

    <br />
    Have a look at the
